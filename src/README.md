# SRC Folder

This directory contains the core source code for the project. All reusable logic, functions, classes, and pipelines should live here, separate from the exploratory or reporting notebooks.

By organizing code into modules here, we ensure better readability, testing, and collaboration, and make it easier to scale and maintain the project.
